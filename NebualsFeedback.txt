User's Guide - (18/20)
- Did not include instructions on how to create object file (-2)
- Good and helfpul error section

Programmer's Guide (15.5/20)
- Rely less on the code being "simple enough" to not need describing. If it's simple enough err on the side of not including a code snippet but describing it (-2)
- Include an overview of the file structure of your project (You will find tests in this folder, code in this folder, etc.)
- Inconsistent use of capitalization (-0.5)
- Wording and chosen phrases need to be more professional (-0.5)
- Grammar and spelling mistakes (-1)
- Needs table of contents (-0.5)
- I like the separation into client and implementation side descirptions


Their Testing (4.5/15)
- No system tests included and no test plan (-9)
- unfinished test case at the bottom of wordTest (-0.5)
- Need more thorough unit testing. Almost all "public" methods should have some unit tests (-1)

Grader Testing (20/25)
- Main bug seems to be that the code outside of trace/step will only execute the first instruction and then not proceed (-2)
- When executing IN and INN instructions, an error will be thrown if more than one input is required (-1)
- PC doesn't overflow when reaching end of memory (-0.5)
- Problems on tests which do something X times. Likely due to improper sign extension of imm5 values (-1)
- rnd doesn't allow negative numbers (-0.5)
- 7 intitial passes
- 11 Fixes
- 12 errors remain

Code (8/10)
- Good build system
- Opening new scanners for every input trap seems inefficient
- Used time limits instead of instruction limits (-0.5)
- Naming convention should be nameInterface and name rather than name and name1 (-0.5)
- Code contained magic numbers (-0.5)
- In stack and trace mode, printing one memory address per line isn't easy to read (-0.5)
